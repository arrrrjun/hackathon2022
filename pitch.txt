Current lotteries require you to trust that whoever is running the lottery is going to run it honestly.
 Sadly, this isn’t always the case. Recently, there was an incident where the lottery was rigged for over $14 Million. This should never happen;
  a player should never have to worry that the people running the lottery have the ability to cheat. 
Blockchain lotteries can fix this by providing a platform that can’t be corrupted or hacked, where the numbers are chosen at random, and everyone can prove that they are chosen at random.
This is easily the most important reason why lotteries would be drastically better on blockchains.
An essential part of any lottery is the trust that each entrant has in their money being treated fairly.
